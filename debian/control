Description: GMapCatcher is an offline maps viewer.
 It downloads tiles automatically from many providers then displays
 them using a custom GUI. User may view maps offline. GMapCatcher is
 independent of map providers' javascript so should work even though 
 the scripts may change. It also provides a downloading tool.
